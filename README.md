# RSS Feed Aggregator

## Introduction
The RSS Feed Aggregator is a web server built with Go that allows users to:

- Add RSS feeds to be collected
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
- Fetch all the latest posts from the RSS feeds they follow

RSS feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content. This project lets you stay updated with your favorite blogs, news sites, and podcasts all in one place!

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in.
- **Add Feeds**: Users can add RSS feeds to be aggregated.
- **Follow Feeds**: Users can follow or unfollow RSS feeds.
- **Retrieve Posts**: Users can fetch the latest posts from the feeds they follow.
- **Background Worker**: Periodically fetches new posts from subscribed feeds.
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Stores user data, feeds, and posts.
